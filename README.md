PROJECT TITTLE: Churns Data 

GOALS: An insightful recommendation based on the data analysised on the reasons behind customer attrition within a defined timeframe. 

TOOL USED: Microsoft Excel

FINDINGs
1) it was acertain that the Electronic check was mostly used by customers in making payment 
2) The fiber optic is mostly used by customers and the chargers is really much
3) month to month contract was highly used on the contracts 
4) the highest tenure received is 72 
5) male has the highest tenure 

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
    Base on the findings and analysis from the visualization. I humbly recommend the following.

1) Charge's are much on Electronic Check and should be considered for reduction for easy payments 
2) tickets distributed among the admin and tech should be increased so as to attract more customers 
3) Charges on Internet usage should be reduced mostly on fiber optic 

Thanks
